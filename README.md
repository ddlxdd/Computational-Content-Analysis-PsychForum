## Research Question

"How can we discern patterns and topics prevalent among individuals with bipolar disorder from their daily experiences shared in the 'How's your mood today' thread on the bipolar sub-forum of Psych Forums?"

For my final project, I plan to analyze user posts from the bipolar sub-forum on Psych Forums, specifically under the thread "How's your mood today." This online community is dedicated to discussions around mental health issues. My focus will be on discerning patterns and topics prevalent among individuals with bipolar disorder as they share their daily experiences. This analysis aims to uncover the nuances of their online discourse, offering a lens into the real-world issues and sentiments they confront regularly.


## Data

I will utilize Python scripts, posts from the "How's your mood today" thread will be scraped. This will include the text of the posts and their timestamps. Care will be taken to adhere to ethical guidelines and the forum's terms of service, ensuring user privacy and data protection.


## How 

To gauge the emotional tone of the posts, sentiment analysis will be conducted. Also, I will use clustering like K-MEAN to to hinden patterns then I will use method Latent Dirichlet Allocation, employed to identify common topics discussed in the forum.
